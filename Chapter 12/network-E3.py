# Exercise 3: 
# Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document 
# from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the overall 
# number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this
# exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.

# TODO: item (2)
